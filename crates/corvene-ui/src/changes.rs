//! Changes sidebar: filter header, "N changed files" row, file list, commit form.
//! `styles/ui/changes/{_changes-list,_commit-message}.scss`.
//!
//! Deviations (GHD `app/src/ui/changes/commit-message.tsx`):
//! - while committing, the summary and description get the read-only
//!   background but keep their text colour and still take typing (GHD's
//!   `readOnly={isCommitting}` dims the text and refuses it).
//! - a detached HEAD gets a commit warning (`730-detached-head-commit-warning`).
//! - committing is off while the repository bisects, with a warning that
//!   offers to stop (`1212-bisect`).
//! - Open in editor / default program act on every selected file, and the
//!   list menu has "Open All in <editor>" (`712-open-multiple-files`).
//! - files matching the `706-changes-hide-globs` patterns are left out of the
//!   list (they are still committed).
//! - while whitespace is hidden, files with whitespace changes only can be
//!   left out too, with a note under the list (`793-hide-whitespace-only-files`).
//! - ↑ / ↓ in an empty summary recall recent commit messages
//!   (`731-recall-commit-messages`).
//! - committing on the default branch asks first
//!   (`732-confirm-commit-to-default-branch`).
//! - the summary can be capped at 72 characters (`733-summary-max-length`).
//! - the commit options menu has Fixup Into ▸ an unpushed commit and Squash
//!   Fixup Commits (`799-fixup-commits`).
//! - a type button before the summary sets its Conventional Commits prefix
//!   (`1301-conventional-commit-types`).
//! - "Ignore All .x Files" items give the number of changed .x files
//!   (`718-ignore-menu-counts`).
//! - "Copy Diff" puts the selected files' changes on the clipboard as a patch
//!   (`714-copy-diff`).
//! - the Filter Options popover has "Renamed files" (`705-renamed-files-filter`).
//! - rows can show the file name without its directory
//!   (`702-changes-file-names-only`).
//! - the list can be ordered by status, file name or `diff.orderFile`
//!   (`703-changes-sort-order`).
//! - the filter text can match as a substring, suffix or exact name
//!   (`704-changes-filter-match`).
//! - a "Committing as Name <email>" line can sit above the summary
//!   (`734-commit-author-line`).
//! - included paths Windows cannot check out get a warning
//!   (`716-windows-invalid-names-warning`).
//! - the file menu can mark files assume-unchanged, the list menu clears the
//!   marks (`715-assume-unchanged`).
//! - a commit made outside Corvene with the drafted summary clears the draft
//!   (`738-clear-message-after-outside-commit`).
//! - the undo bar has a commit context menu (`739-undo-bar-menu`).
//! - an optional tag field tags the new commit (`737-commit-tag-field`).
//! - a single file's menu has "Open With…" (`713-open-file-with`).
//! - rows show "+N -M" before the status icon and the header the totals
//!   (GHD `changes-list.tsx` has none; flag `changes-line-counts`).
//! - a single file's menu adds "Ignore File In" (a nearer `.gitignore`,
//!   `info/exclude`, the global excludes file; flag `ignore-file-targets`).
//! - "Name <email>" in the co-authors box adds a co-author without a GitHub
//!   account (`735-free-form-co-authors`).
//! - co-author suggestions include recent commit authors, also for a name
//!   typed without @ (`770-co-authors-from-history`).
//! - the "N changed files" row ends in a spinner while Discard Changes runs
//!   or a status refresh is slow (`708-changes-busy-indicator`).
//! - rows follow the diff's row height, 9 px taller (`758-diff-line-height`).
//! - adding yourself or a second token for the same co-author is refused
//!   with a hint under the co-authors box (`769-co-author-validation`).
//! - each repository keeps its commit message, also across restarts
//!   (`766-persist-commit-drafts`).
//! - typing a character in the file list types it into the summary
//!   (`615-type-to-commit-summary`).
//! - → in the empty summary types the generated placeholder
//!   (`616-accept-summary-placeholder`).
//! - a single file's menu has "Ignore with Pattern…", a dialog to edit the
//!   pattern before it is added to `.gitignore` (`768-ignore-custom-pattern`).
//! - a file menu can stash the selected files (`777-stash-selected-files`).
//! - the Stashes section lists every stash in place of the Stashed Changes
//!   row, and the list menu has Stash All Changes with Message
//!   (`797-stash-list`, `crate::stash_list`).
//! - the list menu can move the changes to another worktree
//!   (`283-move-changes-to-worktree`).
//! - conflicts left by restoring a stash replace the commit form with a list
//!   of the files to resolve (`774-stash-conflict-flow`,
//!   `crate::stash_conflicts`).
//! - a message the amend, Undo Commit, the commit template or a commit puts
//!   in the form can be taken back with ⌘Z
//!   (`779-undoable-commit-message-replace`).
//! - the commit options gear has "Amend Last Commit"
//!   (`780-amend-from-commit-options`).
//! - a submodule's menu has "Open Submodule in Corvene", which a double-click
//!   does too (`284-open-submodule-from-changes`).
//! - at a rebase's `edit` stop without conflicts the commit form stays, with
//!   "Continue rebase" under it (`782-commit-during-rebase-edit`; GHD
//!   `continue-rebase.tsx` replaces the form during any rebase).
//! - while amending, the commit's author is an editable `Name <email>` with
//!   "Reset to my identity" (`783-amend-author`).
//! - the commit form's top edge drags the description box taller
//!   (`114-resizable-commit-message`).
//! - an untracked folder that is a repository has "Add as Submodule…"
//!   (`785-embedded-repo-commit`, `corvene_core::commit_checks`).
//! - the commit options gear has "Commit to New Branch…"
//!   (`787-commit-to-new-branch`, `corvene_core::new_branch_flows`).
//! - with a `prepare-commit-msg` / `commit-msg` hook, a commit message that
//!   fails the repository rules warns instead of blocking the commit
//!   (`340-message-rules-defer-to-hooks`; GHD `commit-message.tsx`
//!   `hasRepoRuleFailure` blocks it).
//! - a note under the commit button says when the branch's upstream was
//!   deleted on the remote (`1209-current-branch-deleted-hint`), and a lock
//!   that git signs the commit (`commit.gpgsign`, `526-commit-signing`).
//! - a protected branch that takes the user's pushes gets a note above the
//!   commit button (`339-protected-branch-bypass-note`; GHD `commit-warning`
//!   shows the protected warning only for unpushable branches).
//! - a commit that takes a while counts its staged files on the button
//!   ("Committing 1,234 of 5,000 files", then "Writing commit to main") over
//!   a thin bar (`1307-commit-progress`, `corvene_core::commit_progress`;
//!   GHD says "Committing 5000 files to main" until git is done).
